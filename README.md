It helps you generate, save, and export beautiful chord progressions in any major or minor key, with support for advanced chord types.

Features

All keys – generate chords in every major & minor scale.

Extended & altered chords – major 7th, dominant 7th, diminished, half-diminished, and altered variations.

Save & load – keep your favorite progressions to revisit later.

MIDI export – instantly turn your progressions into .mid files for use in any DAW.

Random or custom – let the app inspire you with random progressions, or build your own step by step.

Chord details – view chord tones (e.g. Cmaj7 = C E G B).

Example Use

Pick a key (e.g. A minor).

Choose the length of your progression (4, 8 chords, etc.).

Get a progression like:

Am7 – Dm7 – G7 – Cmaj7


Save it for later, or export as a MIDI file and drop it into your DAW.

Most chord tools are bloated, paywalled, or tied to specific DAWs.
This one is free, offline, and honest, good music software.
