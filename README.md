Chord Progression Maker is a simple, free, and privacy-friendly tool for musicians, producers, and learners.
It helps you generate, save, and export beautiful chord progressions in any major or minor key, with support for advanced chord types.

✨ Features

🎼 All keys – generate chords in every major & minor scale.

🎶 Extended & altered chords – major 7th, dominant 7th, diminished, half-diminished, and altered variations.

💾 Save & load – keep your favorite progressions to revisit later.

🎧 MIDI export – instantly turn your progressions into .mid files for use in any DAW.

🎲 Random or custom – let the app inspire you with random progressions, or build your own step by step.

🔍 Chord details – view chord tones (e.g. Cmaj7 = C E G B).

🚀 Example Use

Pick a key (e.g. A minor).

Choose the length of your progression (4, 8 chords, etc.).

Get a progression like:

Am7 – Dm7 – G7 – Cmaj7


Save it for later, or export as a MIDI file and drop it into your DAW.

🎯 Why this app?

Most chord tools are bloated, paywalled, or tied to specific DAWs.
This one is free, offline, and honest — just good music software.
